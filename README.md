##  Background
Daegu is South Korea's third-largest metropolis after Seoul and Busan. With a 2024 population estimated at 2,179,929 (worldpopulationreview.com), demand for housing is high. Limited residential land makes apartments the primary housing solution in Daegu, mirroring other densely populated cities. According to 2022 data, there are roughly 239,000 apartment buildings in Daegu (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1303257/south-korea-apartments-in-daegu-by-number-of-stories/#statisticsContainer).

Daegu's rapid development has fueled growing demand for apartment rentals. Property agents facilitate most apartment transactions, offering convenience and streamlining the buying and selling process for both parties.

Apartment pricing poses a challenge due to limited land resources and dense urban activity. Individual sellers often struggle to determine fair market values for their units. Setting prices too high hinders sales, while prices that are too low can sacrifice profits.

## Problem Statement
Accurately determining apartment prices aligned with the market poses a significant challenge for real estate agents, especially in Daegu, South Korea. Prices serve as a crucial factor for potential buyers â€“ they critically compare offerings based on price, facilities, and quality.

With strong demand for apartments in Daegu, property agents face intense competition. Setting competitive rental prices that accurately reflect an apartment's features and amenities is vital for agents to retain customers and meet sales targets.

To address this challenge, a model capable of predicting competitive rental prices would streamline apartment pricing for agents. This would offer valuable support in a dynamic market landscape and ultimately facilitate more successful transactions

## Goal
This project aims to develop machine learning models capable of predicting competitive sale prices for rental. To achieve this, the models will leverage characteristics such as apartment size, location, and amenities. These models are essential for property agents to price rentals appropriately, maximizing satisfaction for prospective tenants while improving profitability. The accurate sales price model provides vital guidance for sellers or property developers, facilitating better-informed decisions regarding pricing strategies.

## Analytic Approach
The method entails examining statistics to find trends and connections between the characteristics of apartments and their selling prices. The fact that the outcome variable (Sales Price) is continuous suggests that the regression model is appropriate for this purpose. The selling price will be estimated by this model using attributes of the apartments as predictors.

## Limitation
1. Regional Specificity: The model is tailored to the Daegu real estate market and may not accurately translate to other regions due to local variations in pricing factors.
2. Temporal Dependency: The dataset reflects a specific timeframe. Therefore, the model may not fully account for potential market fluctuations and evolving trends over time.
3. Subjective Factors: The dataset might not encompass influential subjective factors such as a property's aesthetic appeal or the perceived desirability of its neighborhood.
